# example-iex-owner-report

This is an example IEX template to show a potential Owner Report.

Things to note:

- It's just normal ReactJS app
- The file called context.json will be injected
    - This file contains a json object with: company, sender, contact, and entity
    - Entity can be anything
- To test it out, normal `yarn start`
